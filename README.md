RCPSP Resting Framework
=======================

A framework for experimenting with RCPSP instances and Partial Order Schedules

NOTE: This code exists merely as a working prototype.
Most of the code is ugly, very complex, and probably won't work on instances I haven't used it on.
There is an intention to increase the code quality, but that does not have priority as long as my thesis is not completely written.
