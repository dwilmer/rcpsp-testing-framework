RCPSP Resting Framework
=======================

A framework for experimenting with RCPSP instances and Partial Order Schedules

NOTE: This code exists merely as a working prototype.
Although some effort has been put into refactoring, some code is still ugly and messy.
Some documentation is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/dwilmer/rcpsp-testing-framework/wiki), but this does not have priority.

Feel free to ask, post issues, or fork this project.
